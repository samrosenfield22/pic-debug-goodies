# pic-debug-goodies #

This is a small library of debugging/instrumentation functions for PIC microcontrollers.
Its purpose is to provide a easy, painless way to debug firmware outside of MPLABX's debugger, while being as 
flexible and low-memory as possible.
At the moment, pic-debug-goodies contains three libraries:

* *softUart*: a dead-simple, transmit-only software UART for 

* *dlibc*: 

* *assert*:
